# Assignment: Create a Password Generator

## Overview
In this assignment, you will create a simple password generator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (DOM manipulation). The password generator will allow users to specify the length of the password and whether to include:
- Uppercase letters
- Lowercase letters
- Numbers
- Special characters

## Assignment Instructions
1. **Complete the HTML File**:
   - Create a form where the user can select the password length (between 8-128 characters).
   - Include checkboxes for options to include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.
   - Add a button to generate the password.
   - Display the generated password in a text field.

2. **Complete the CSS File**:
   - Style the form elements to make the application visually appealing. Consider adding padding, margins, colors, and hover effects for buttons.

3. **Implement the JavaScript Logic**:
   - Create the logic to generate a password based on the user’s selected criteria.
   - Ensure that the generated password meets the requirements based on the options chosen by the user.
   - Display the generated password in the designated text field.

4. **Bonus**: 
   - Add functionality to the "Copy to Clipboard" button to allow users to copy the generated password with a single click.
